'''
LocalRunner class.

The local runner uses a thread pool executor to dispatch the runs and executed them in
parallel or in series (if only one thread is available).

At the moment, the user need to use QueueJobs.wait() on the last QueueJobs before
the program exit(). If not, the thread pool is terminated and only the remaining jobs
will be completed and the wait list (jobs with dependencies) cannot be added to the
pool queue and won't be executed.
